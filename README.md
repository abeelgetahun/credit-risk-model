# Credit Risk Probability Model for Alternative Data

An End-to-End Implementation for Building, Deploying, and Automating a Credit Risk Model

## Project Overview

This project develops a credit scoring model for Bati Bank's partnership with an eCommerce platform to enable buy-now-pay-later services. The model transforms behavioral transaction data into predictive risk signals using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) patterns to assess credit risk probability.

## Credit Scoring Business Understanding

### Basel II Accord's Impact on Model Development

The Basel II Capital Accord's emphasis on risk measurement fundamentally shapes our approach to model development in several critical ways:

**Risk-Based Capital Requirements**: Basel II mandates that banks maintain capital reserves proportional to their risk exposure. This requires our model to provide accurate, quantifiable risk assessments that can be validated and audited by regulatory bodies.

**Model Interpretability**: The accord emphasizes the need for banks to demonstrate their understanding of risk models. This necessitates building interpretable models where feature contributions can be clearly explained to regulators, stakeholders, and customers. Every prediction must be traceable back to specific customer behaviors and characteristics.

**Documentation and Validation**: Basel II requires comprehensive documentation of model development, validation, and ongoing monitoring. Our model must include detailed methodology documentation, performance metrics, and regular backtesting procedures to ensure regulatory compliance.

**Risk Management Framework**: The accord mandates integrated risk management systems, requiring our model to fit within broader risk assessment frameworks and provide consistent risk measures across different business units.

### Necessity and Risks of Proxy Variable Creation

**Why Proxy Variables Are Necessary**:
- **Absence of Direct Default Data**: Unlike traditional banks, we lack historical loan default information since this is a new partnership venture
- **Alternative Data Utilization**: We must leverage transactional behavioral data to infer creditworthiness, creating innovative risk assessment methodologies
- **Market Entry Strategy**: Creating proxy variables allows us to enter the credit market quickly while building a foundation for future direct default data collection

**Business Risks of Proxy-Based Predictions**:

*Financial Risks*:
- **False Positive Risk**: Incorrectly labeling good customers as high-risk could result in lost revenue opportunities and reduced market penetration
- **False Negative Risk**: Approving high-risk customers could lead to significant financial losses through defaults and write-offs
- **Proxy Validity Risk**: If our behavioral proxy doesn't accurately reflect true credit risk, entire portfolio performance could be compromised

*Operational Risks*:
- **Model Drift**: Customer behavior patterns may change over time, potentially invalidating our proxy assumptions
- **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Using non-traditional risk indicators may face increased regulatory examination and approval challenges
- **Customer Experience**: Incorrect risk assessments could damage customer relationships and brand reputation

*Strategic Risks*:
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: If proxy variables prove less accurate than competitors' traditional methods, we may lose market share
- **Data Dependency**: Over-reliance on specific behavioral patterns could create vulnerabilities if data sources change or become unavailable

### Model Complexity Trade-offs in Regulated Financial Context

**Simple, Interpretable Models (Logistic Regression with WoE)**:

*Advantages*:
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Easy to explain to regulators with clear coefficient interpretations and statistical significance testing
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Business stakeholders can understand and trust model decisions, facilitating buy-in and adoption
- **Audit Trail**: Simple models provide clear pathways from input features to predictions, essential for regulatory examinations
- **Stable Performance**: Less prone to overfitting and more stable across different market conditions
- **Implementation Speed**: Faster to deploy and integrate into existing banking systems

*Disadvantages*:
- **Limited Predictive Power**: May miss complex patterns and interactions in customer behavior data
- **Feature Engineering Dependency**: Requires extensive manual feature engineering to capture non-linear relationships
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: May be outperformed by competitors using more sophisticated approaches

**Complex, High-Performance Models (Gradient Boosting)**:

*Advantages*:
- **Superior Predictive Accuracy**: Can capture complex, non-linear patterns and feature interactions automatically
- **Competitive Edge**: Better risk assessment could lead to more precise pricing and improved portfolio performance
- **Data Efficiency**: Can extract more value from available behavioral data through automatic feature interaction discovery
- **Robustness**: Less dependent on perfect feature engineering and can handle mixed data types effectively

*Disadvantages*:
- **Regulatory Challenges**: "Black box" nature makes it difficult to explain decisions to regulators and may face approval difficulties
- **Model Risk**: Higher complexity increases model risk, requiring more sophisticated validation and monitoring procedures
- **Implementation Complexity**: Requires more resources for deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
- **Explainability Requirements**: Needs additional tools (SHAP, LIME) for post-hoc explanations, adding operational complexity

**Recommended Approach**:
Given the regulated financial context, a hybrid strategy is optimal:
1. **Start with interpretable models** for initial regulatory approval and stakeholder confidence
2. **Develop complex models in parallel** for performance benchmarking and competitive analysis
3. **Implement explainable AI techniques** to bridge the gap between performance and interpretability
4. **Establish gradual migration path** from simple to complex models as regulatory comfort and internal capabilities mature

This approach balances regulatory requirements with competitive performance while building organizational capability for advanced risk modeling.
